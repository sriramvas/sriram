Have you ever stopped to think about what reality really is? 

I mean, it's all around us, but it's like trying to describe water to a fish â€“ we're so immersed in it that we barely notice it.

Now, you might think, "Well, that's easy. Science has it all figured out, right?". We're taught that everything is made of atoms, that it all started with the Big Bang, we evolved from apes and so on.

But what if I told you that this question is, in fact, far from answered? Even with all our knowledge, we're still barely scratching the surface - and might forever do so!

## Perception

Let's start with something we all trust: our eyes.

Take a look at the image above. See those squares labeled A and B? Believe it or not, they're the same color.

Wild, right? Our brains are playing tricks on us. This little illusion shows us that what we see isn't always what's really there. It's like our brain is an overeager Instagram filter, that tweaks reality before we even realize it.

While we usually assume eyes to create accurate representations of the world, our perception is shaped by context, expectations, and the way our brains process information more than we realize.

## Concepts

*say you visit a village in africa, and want to explain a child about "existence of Burj-Khalifa". there is an added condition - you cannot use attributes of existing things the child knows.*

without using building, tall, glass, skyscraper, dubai, you can never convey Burj-Khalifa to the child 

this is an important concept that highlights, **all new knowledge can only be understood if it fits within our existing mental models**

It's turtles all the way down!

## Maths

## Physics
Add about Measurements

## Language

Words are merely tags that point to shared experiences. The word "red" doesn't encode the actual experience of seeing red.

Language is, hence at best, a low-resolution translator of reality.

## Logic
 lets begin with a quote "logic isn't supposed to tell us what is true, it is supposed to tell us what follows from what."
- logic is transitive and causal, it shows how you link 2 or more chain of rules together
- Logic essentially consists in a set of operations for deriving a statement from other statements. It brings nothing new to the table. 
- The conclusion merely flows from the premises as their inevitable consequence:
	1. All birds have feathers. (Premise 1)
	2. Woodpeckers are birds. (Premise 2)
	3. Therefore, woodpeckers have feathers. (Conclusion)
- However the major problem with logic here is that it relies on premises that are founded, not on logic itself, but on inductive reasoning

While powerful, logic is fundamentally a tool for deriving statements from other statements. It doesn't generate new information but reveals what follows from our premises. Moreover, these premises often rely on inductive reasoning rather than pure logic.

## Faith

it's like saying we have a problem, we need a variable X to solve it

just the above can be a big leap for many. here is an example.

when your math teacher says we need X to solve the equation: 
- we don't immediately ask what is X?
- why do we need that? 
- you are just drawing a cross on the board, how will it help us?

instead of asking these, we trust the teacher's take, follow the math, and voila the problem is solved and X now has a value - the teacher was right!

We demand a similar openness here as we uncover truth.

Why do we need truth to exist, and why must it be unknown? These questions form the foundation of our epistemological journey. The concept of an unknown truth acts as a placeholder, much like a variable in mathematics. When a math teacher introduces 'X' to solve an equation, we don't question its existence or purpose; we trust the process and follow along. Similarly, in our pursuit of knowledge, we must remain open to the possibility of an unknown truth that guides our inquiry.
